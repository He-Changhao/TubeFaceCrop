# TubeFaceCrop
TubeFaceCrop is a versatile tool designed to crawl videos from YouTube and perform facial cropping on them. It automatically identifies and removes faces from the videos, enabling users to preprocess video data efficiently. The processed videos are then sliced into 5-second segments for further analysis or storage.
